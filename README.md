# Todo List
My to-do list was a simple project intended on taking in tasks and storing it locally. 
# How Its Made
# Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
First I made the click events that call the function when the user inputs and submits information
Then I built an empty array that will hold all the li. After, I built a function that will add inputs to the array. Also I created an li element and append children text so that each task is  appended to the dom. Lastly I added a function to let me cross off completed tasks.

# Optomization
The project is still in the development stage. 
# Lesson Learned
Learned how to create nodes using Vanilla Javascript, append to the dom, and prevent default
